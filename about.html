  <h1>About Leosb App</h1>
  <p>
    Leosb App is a web application under active development.
    It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and hosted on GitHub Pages.

    Our goal is to build a real application that will later integrate
    advanced features such as authentication and Pi Browser support.
